Hello, I am TheBintedBogos. I am a personal developer just trying new code.

My coding journey began on the Scratch coding website where i still work on projects to this day.

The two main languages im learning at this very moment are C# and Java.

I am using Visual Studio Code as my editor which is an editor that my friend suggested to me.
